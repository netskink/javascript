Hello

This weeks linear algebra class starts off with a fun demo. Its a javascript page for students to practice with matrix transforms.

Consider it for its value as sample javascript or as a game.


As for the game, the upper left is a matrix transform.  The goal is pick a transform matrix to move the dark blue image to the light blue image.

I know this is common knowledge for John and Barn, if you are rusty as I am on how to do this here's how: (its why i'm taking the class.)

1. Turn on the grid, so you can see the relationship in sizes. Adjust the scale mentally to be 2x so we don't have to use a multiplier.
2. Mentally, place the unit basis vector for X on the grid and notice where it points.  (In the first image test it points to his left foot. ie. make a vector of [1,0]     if you use the literal scale then its [2,0]  and place it on the grid and it points to his foot.)  
3.  Then notice where his foot is in the second picture.  (In the light blue pic its the same place.)
4. The first (X) column of the transform matrix is the vector that results. (In this case, its the same.)  
5. Record this as 1,0 in the upper left transform matrix for the first column.
6. Then place the unit basis vector for Y on the grid and notice where it points. (Its about where his right hand touches the y axis.)
7.  Then look at where his right hand moves in the light blue version of timmy, its about [1,1].
8.  Use this to be the transform for the y column in upper left.


This results in 

1 1
0 1

Click timmy and transform him to the light blue position.
